      <p>Lebowski ipsum one a those days, huh. Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you. Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. I—the royal we, man, you know, the editorial. You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.</p>

      <p>Nice marmot. Vee belief in nossing. I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye. What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties? Zere ARE no ROOLZ! You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus! You know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback. Vee don't care. Vee still vant zat money or vee fuck you up.</p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />



      <h1 id="blap">Blap</h1>
      <p>Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? Well sure, look at it! Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers— and that's cool, that's cool. Whose toe was it, Walter? Another Caucasian, Gary. You're going to enter a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework. We know you stole a car.</p>

      <p>My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites. Fuck it, Dude. Let's go bowling. A dick, man! And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other —in bed with everybody— fabulous stuff, man. Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame. Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.</p>

      <p>I did not watch my buddies die face down in the mud so that this fucking strumpet. How's the smut business, Jackie? Lady, I got buddies who died face-down in the mud so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant! I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski. A man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson". Darkness warshed over the Dude— darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night. There was no bottom.</p><br /> <br /><br /><br />



      <h1 id="burp">Burp</h1>
      <p>They were Nazis, Dude? So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh? They're nihilists. You know, little of this, little of that. I, uh… money, yeah, I gotta respectfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all. Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?</p>

      <p>They finally did it. They killed my fucking car. I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! And let's also not forget—let's not forget, Dude—that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for domestic, you know, within the city —that isn't legal either. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. Is this your homework, Larry?</p>

      <p>Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house. Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski! A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS! YOU ARE SCUM, MAN! Hey! This is a private residence, man! Thankie… Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? I FUCK YOU! YOU CANNOT HURT ME! I BELIEF IN NUSSING! This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is—are you ready for this? —Arthur Digby Sellers.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />



      <h1 id="charlie">CHAWLIE BIT MEE</h1>
      <p>Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball. Strong men also cry… Strong men also cry. My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong? Sure. That and a pair of testicles. She's gotta feed the monkey, I mean —hasn't that ever occurred to you, Sir? A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'.</p>

      <p>And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust. You make everything a fucking travesty!</p><br /><br /><br /><br />



      <h1 id="lessa">Let's Do dis</h1>
      <p>Za, okay, I bring mein toolz. Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties —just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man—I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?—but sometimes there's a man. Fucking fascist! LOGJAMMIN'. The nail polish, Walter. Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.</p> <br />

      <h1 id="lessa1">Let's Do dis 1</h1>
      <p>Vee vant zat money, Lebowski. That's right Dude; they pee on your fucking Rug. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. Where's my goddamn money, you bum?! Keep your ugly fucking goldbricking ass out of my beach community! I am the Walrus. Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man— what's in it for the Dude?</p><br />



      <h1 id="lessa2">Let's Do dis 2</h1>
      <p>I've had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man. She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend. I'm just helping her conceive, man! But that is up to little Larry here. Isn't it, Larry? Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. Call the medics, Dude. Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?</p><br />

      <h1 id="lessa3">Let's Do dis 3</h1>
      <p>To use the parlance of our times. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug. That guy treats objects like women, man. I hope you're not avoiding this call because of the rug, which, I assure you, is not a problem. Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together. Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides.</p><br />



      <h1 id="lessa4">Let's Do dis 4</h1>
      <p>Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und skvush it, Lebowski! Fuck you man! You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab! Come and get it. Fucking nihilist. Say friend, ya got any more a that good sarsaparilla? I just want to say, sir, that we're both enormous—on a personal level. Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it? Brandt can't watch though. Or he has to pay a hundred.</p> <br />

      <h1 id="lessa5">Let's Do dis 5</h1>
      <p>This Chinaman is not the issue! We wanted to talk about little Larry. May we come in? Yes, so we were informed. However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle. He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus. Shomer shabbos. I want a fucking lawyer, man. I want Bill Kunstler. You think veer kidding und making mit de funny stuff?</p><br /><br /><br /><br />



      <h1 id="donny">Yeah, Donny!</h1>
      <p>Shut the fuck up, Donny. Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire! Fuck your sympathy! I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson! I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement —The original Port Huron Statement. Not the compromised second draft. This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?</p>

      <p>How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter? What's a pederast, Walter? Ja, it seems you forgot our little deal, Lebowski. Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat! The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight-year-old. All right, Plan B. You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry. This is quite a pad you got here, man. Completely unspoiled.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />



      <h1 id="last">Last One</h1>
      <p>Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski. Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers? …which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide—but sometimes there's a man… sometimes there's a man. That fucking bitch! These men are nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of. 1972 Pontiac LeBaron. The Knutsens. It's a wandering daughter job. Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Knutsen. Her parents want her back.</p>

      <p>Obviously you're not a golfer. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker. Wait in the car, Donny. I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC and bowling. Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.</p>

      <p>What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?! I—the royal we, man, you know, the editorial. Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house. Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh—you know?</p>

      <p>WE HAVE BUNNY. GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES. AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS. NO FUNNY STUFF. That's right Dude; they pee on your fucking Rug. We want that money, Lebowski. Would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man. There's no fucking reason—here's my point, Dude—there's no fucking reason.</p><br /><br />
